		<p class="font1">FONT 1! Now, this is very much a he-snapped/he-snapped situation; it's easy to see Daly's side of things here. You play like garbage, the last thing you want to deal with is some Aussie paparazzi-wannabe shoving his little digital camera in your face. "I was looking to take a drop and a camera was 6 inches away from my face," Daly said in a statement after the round. </p>
		<p class="font2">FONT 2! We don't go out of our way to find stories that make John Daly look bad. Really, I swear. They just kind of drop in our laps, like this newest one: in Australia on Thursday, Daly didn't exactly take kindly to being photographed. Daly, finishing out an ugly 6-over 78 at the Australian Open that likely took him out of cut contention, grabbed the guy's camera and smashed it into a tree. </p>
